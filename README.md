# Iris-Classification-ML-Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify different species of iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset, a popular dataset in the machine learning community, is used for this classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. It consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is labeled with three different classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the iris classification project.
- `iris.csv`: CSV file containing the Iris dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd iris-classification
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, train different machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Results

After running the code in the notebook, you will obtain the results of the different machine learning models evaluated for iris classification. The accuracy of each model are presented and can be used to compare their performance.
